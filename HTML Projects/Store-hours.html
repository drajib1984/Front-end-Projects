            <p>
              Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or
              saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it
              is a good source of protein. A typical homemade plain dosa without
              oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and
              16% protein. The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and
              vitamin C content.

            <summary>How to prepare dosa?</summary>
            <p>
              A mixture of rice and black or green gram that has been soaked in
              water is ground finely to form a batter. Some add a bit of soaked
              fenugreek seeds and the secret recipe we have with us. The
              proportion of rice to lentils is where the dosa gets the best
              taste & our chefs have highly mastered in that art. The batter is
              allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get
              the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot
              griddle greased with oil or ghee. It is spread out with the base
              of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either to be
              thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot,
              either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is usually served
              with chutney and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can
              be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.
